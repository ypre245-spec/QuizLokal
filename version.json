Auto-Marking: Students are automatically marked "Present" in the register for the current day when they either join a game room or claim their Daily XP Bonus.

Real-Time Sync: The teacher's attendance dashboard now polls the server every few seconds, updating the list and statistics bars instantly as students log in, without needing a page refresh.

Reporting: Added date range filters to generate PDF Matrix reports or CSV exports for specific periods (e.g., monthly) or specific sections.

Review Lock

Teacher Control: A new "Allow Student Review" checkbox in the Game Setup modal (default: OFF).

Data Security: When disabled, the server does not send the answer key or full question list to student devices after the game ends, preventing answer leakage.

Student UI: The "Review Answers" button is hidden and replaced with a "Review Disabled" message on the student's result screen if the teacher has not granted permission."
